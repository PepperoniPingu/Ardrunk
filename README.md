# Ardrunk
An Arduino alcohol meter. Can measure the alcohol level in the air and estimate blood alcohol level (BAC). Uses the HS135 gas sensor and an SSD1306 OLED. 

It uses two buttons. One is used to toggle between BAC and alcohol air level measured in ppm. The other is used to toggle between tare on/off. 

This sensor is only calibrated in code to the data sheet and therefore no precision is guaranteed. 

Depends on Adafruit SSD1306 and GFX librarys.
